## Keynote Talk
### Memory: The DaMoN Demon
#### Frank Hady, Intel Fellow, Intel’s Office of the CTO Systems Architecture and Engineering Group

**Abstract**: Memory technology limitations bedevil current computing systems and data management does not escape. As silicon scaling delivers ever faster compute, memory falls further behind exposing capacity, bandwidth, and power deficiencies in our systems. Seeing these issues, computer architects propose memory hierarchy changes only to find most applications shrink-wrapped to the current hierarchy and unable to change. Data management applications provide an innovation bright-spot with researchers and developers ready to co-optimize from application-to-hardware to deliver improved performance. Hierarchy improvements often matter here first. Sitting squarely at this confluence, DaMoN serves to engender such co-optimizations. With this in mind, we will set a memory technology baseline using memory silicon trends and constraints. Additionally, we will set a memory system baseline summarizing current system memory architectures and issues. Next, we will look at the undeniable influence AI is exerting on the hierarchy. Taking memory technology, systems, and applications together, we will speculate on memory hierarchy changes to expect – potentially creating opportunities for future data management applications. One such change is already visible in CXL-enabled memory hierarchies envisioned to deliver higher capacity and perhaps more. Finally, we will speculate further on system optimizations around memory that are the subject of current research, like memory sharing and near memory computing. Active audience engagement is encouraged, as the goal of this presentation is a maximally productive DaMoN focused on vanquishing the memory demon.

## Fresh Thinking Talk
### Cost-Intelligent Data Analytics in the Cloud
#### Huanchen Zhang, Assistant Professor, IIIS (Yao Class) at Tsinghua University

**Abstract**: For decades, database research has focused on optimizing performance under a fixed amount of resources. As more and more database applications move to the public cloud, we argue that it is time to make cost a first-class citizen when solving database optimization problems. In this talk, I will introduce the concept of "cost intelligence" and then sketch the architecture of a cloud data warehouse designed toward this goal. The project is in its early stages, and we would appreciate your valuable feedback.
